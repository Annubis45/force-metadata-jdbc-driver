# force-metadata-jdbc-driver

This Java code allows a Salesforce org's schema to be exported via the wonderful [SchemaSpy](http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/) that produces elegantly formatted ERDs linked together by web pages containing all the detail. It was originally shared via this [Google Code Project](https://code.google.com/archive/p/force-metadata-jdbc-driver/), but that moved into an archive mode in 2016.

A small diagram example:
