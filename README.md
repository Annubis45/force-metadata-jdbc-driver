# force-metadata-jdbc-driver

This Java code allows a Salesforce org's schema to be exported via the wonderful http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/ that produces elegantly formatted ERDs linked together by web pages containing all the detail. It was originally shared at https://code.google.com/archive/p/force-metadata-jdbc-driver/, but that Google Code Project Hosting Service moved into an archive mode in 2016.
